## Developing

After setting up your SvelteKit project and installing the necessary dependencies using `npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`, you can start a development server by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab

pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
